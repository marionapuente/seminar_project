'prepare_MUA_dataset.py' is designed to process multi-unit activity (MUA) data from macaque monkey experiments. It follows these steps:

- Extract and structure neural responses (MUA) from .mat HDF5 files.
- Label each electrode response by its cortical region (V1, V4, IT).
- Associate each stimulus image with object categories.
- Save the final enriched dataset as a CSV file for further analysis.
